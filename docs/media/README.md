Place lightweight demonstration clips (e.g., <20 MB) in this folder so the main
README can embed them without bloating the repository. The project expects:

- `moose_before.mp4`: Source clip before object removal.
- `moose_after.mp4`: Corresponding clip after inpainting/removal.

Both files are intentionally excluded from `.gitignore` so you can version only
these curated samples while keeping the rest of the data tree local.
