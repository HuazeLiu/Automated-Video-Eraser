## Outputs Directory

Use this tree to stage artifacts that you might want to review or share later:

- `videos/`: Rendered demonstrations such as `video_*_output.mp4`
- Additional evaluation reports, screenshots, or export files

The entire `outputs/` branch is ignored by Git (except for this README). Keep results locally and copy only the items you intend to publish.*** End Patch
